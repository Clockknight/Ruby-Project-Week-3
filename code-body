=begin
In this program, you take the role of another worker for MegaCorp, this time completing tasks from a to do list. 
The list is made of two items, pulled from a list of 4. 
Test the program here: https://repl.it/@Clockknight/MegaCorp-ToDo
=end

#This program relies heavily on while loops, so a few variables are initiated so portions are not skipped.
#Area for initializing variables:
  #Initialize todo, since a list of 2 is guaranteed.
todo = 2 
answer = 0
  #Initialize the two list variables so that they can be called in the while loop, and possible skip the loop if they do not equal eachother.
list1 = rand(4)
list2 = rand(4)
  puts "randomizing"
while list1 == list2
  list1 = rand(4)
  list2 = rand(4)
  puts "randomizing"
end
#declare these strings so that they aren't repeated, and the code looks cleaner.
todo0 = "Move all 17 boxes in area A of Shipping to area B."
todo1 = "Mix 20 to 30 ounces of mixture A-32 in Chemicals and Solutions."
todo2 = "Prep any multiple of 5 carts of bricks in Shipping."
todo3 = "Look through the applicant pile and find 2 to 4 employees for MegaCorp to hire."

=begin 
Each of the four choices of list1 and list 2 lead to a different scenario. Each scenario also has their own goal.
0 - move all 17 boxes from area A to area 
1 - mix (20..30) oz of mixture A-32
2 - prep multiples of 5 carts of bricks
3 - find (2..4) employees for MegaCorp store 
Begin the ToDo List.
